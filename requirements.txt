🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the selling price of used cars based on multiple features such as manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and ownership history.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview

Predicting the price of a used car is a common and practical regression problem in the automotive and data science domain.
In this project, several machine learning models are trained and evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected and deployed as an interactive web application.

This project demonstrates:

Real-world data preprocessing

Feature encoding and scaling

Model comparison and selection

Model persistence using joblib

End-to-end ML deployment
